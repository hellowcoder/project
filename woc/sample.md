   - Define Firestore database structure for rooms and chat data.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Integrate Firebase SDK for real-time interaction.

3. **Socket Programming**:
   - Establish sockets for continuous updates and state changes in rooms.

4. **Codeforces API Integration**:
   - Link Codeforces APIs to pull and validate problems.

5. **Real-Time Submission and Winner Declaration**:
   - Implement logic to track and validate real-time submissions.
   - Automate winner declaration based on correct submissions and timing.

6. **Room Management Automation**:
   - Develop mechanisms for automatic room cleanup after matches.
   - Ensure efficient handling of database entries for scalability.

7. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Conduct rigorous testing to ensure smooth user experience.
   - Address potential performance issues and optimize code.

8. **Documentation and Deployment**:
   - Prepare detailed documentation for developers and users.
   - Deploy the extension on an open-source platform (e.g., GitHub).
